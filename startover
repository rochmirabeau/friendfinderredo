I want to have an object
	name:	string
	photo:	url 
	scores:	array of answers

a function
	takes 2 objects
	compares the scores arrays
	returns the difference between the scores
	

another function
	takes an object{you} and an array of objects[rick and morty cast]
	compares the scores of you and each object in the array
	returns the object that has the lowest difference in scores (your best friend)
